## Question 1: Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:

Records
Indexing
I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers, George

### Response to Question 1:

Hi George,

I can certainly help you understand the concepts around search engines which in turn will give you a good confidence during the onboarding journey.

**Records**:
A record is an object you add to an index and want to search for. It can contain any number of attributes.
Here is an example of a record, formatted in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):
```json
{
  "name": "Iphone 6 64Gb",
  "brand": "Apple",
  "color": "Gold",
  "categories": ["smartphone", "phone", "electronics"],
  "price": 789
}
```
A collection of objects is referred as records and here is an example of records, formatted in JSON:
```json
[
    {
        "name": "Iphone 6 64Gb",
        "brand": "Apple",
        "color": "Gold",
        "categories": ["smartphone", "phone", "electronics"],
        "price": 789
    },
    {
        "name": "Iphone 6 128Gb",
        "brand": "Apple",
        "color": "Silver",
        "categories": ["smartphone", "phone", "electronics"],
        "price": 999
    }    
]
```
**Indexing**:
An index is the place where the data used by a search engine is stored.
It is the equivalent for search of what a “table” is for a database. Unlike a database table, an index is optimized for search operations.

For example, in an ecommerce website, the index would be a complete list of all products with a custom ranking.
The process of building an index is referred to as indexing.

We can help you with some suggestions for **custom ranking** after understanding your business metrics. We recommend our customers to set the custom ranking with their business metrics.

For example, in an ecommerce website, popularity or rating is a common metric used for custom ranking.

Please let me know if you would like to further discuss this over a call.

Thanks & Regards,
Ganesh

## Question 2: Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards, Matt

### Response to Question 2:

Hi Matt,

Sorry to hear about your experience with the new dashbaord design. Please be assured that we can work together to overcome this inconvenience.

I understand from your problem statement that you clear and delete the indexes through the dashbaord. In case you are not aware, Algolia provides many integrations where your system can be integrated with Algolia through which clearing and deleting indexes could be achieved automatically once you clear the records at your system without needing an extra step for you to do it from the dashboard.

Please let me know if you would like to explore this option in case you haven't.

Thanks & Regards,
Ganesh
